<br>I am a 3rd PhD student at <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a>. I work in the <a href="https://econ.georgetown.edu/">Economics Department</a>, and am advised by Dr. <a href="https://editorialexpress.com/jrust/">John Rust</a> and Dr. <a href="http://www.nathanhmiller.org/">Nathan Miller</a>. My research interests lie in market design for artificial intelligence. I am currently developing market designs to prevent algorithmic collusion in dynamic double auctions.<br><br>

Prior to my Ph.D. I worked at American Express for 3 years, in the Customer Marketing Data Science team - where I worked on building machine learning models to improve customer engagement and spend. I have experience in macroeconomic modelling through my internship at <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/">Reserve Bank of India</a> and my Research Assistantship to <a href="https://www.mse.ac.in/faculty/c-rangarajanmse-ac-in/">Dr. C Rangarajan</a>. I got my Masters in Economics from <a href="https://www.mse.ac.in/">Madras School of Economics</a>, and my thesis research on estimating non-linear Taylor rules was advised by <a href="https://www.mse.ac.in/faculty/naveen/">Dr. Naveen Srinivasan</a>.<br><br>

I hail from Hyderabad, India and love to play soccer in my spare time. Free free to reach out at pp712[at]georgetown[.]edu.<br>
